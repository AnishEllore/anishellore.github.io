I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus currently doing thesis under [Prof. Chittaranjan Hota](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/chittaranjanhota/Profile). In my research at BITS, I focus on building scalable machine learning models keeping privacy and communication overhead in mind.
