Hi! Welcome to my page.<br />

I am Anish, an MS CS graduate student in Virginia Tech, expected to graduate in Spring 23.<br />

After my Bachelors in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, India, I joined the OPPO India R&D centre as a software engineer. There I worked on improving the OPPO's WIFI module for different Android baseline projects.<br />

During my undergraduate studies, I completed a Summer Internship at Publicis Sapient. There, I built and deployed an end-to-end stream processing application using Azure Event Hubs and Spark's Structured Streaming.<br />

Shortly after, in my final year at BITS, I did quality research work under Prof. Chittaranjan Hota and Dr. Paresh Saxena, publishing papers in top international conferences. Initially, in research, I worked on Time series Anomaly Detection proposing an algorithm to detect sequential anomalies and solve class imbalance problem. Later, I worked on Federated Learning, where I designed algorithms to reduce the FL's communication overhead.
